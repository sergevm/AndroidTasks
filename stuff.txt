Remarks on the setup of the project:

2012/08/17:
-----------
After upgrading to ADT 20.x, the app crashed on the emulator, because appartently the tools changed the way that it chooses what dependencies to include in the deployment package. 

Basically I removed the dependencies from the build path configuration (guice etc), and added a libs folder where I put the dependencies. The name of the folder mathers, as the dependencies included in the folder are automatically added to the "Android dependencies" folder.

Actually, I simply followed the issue resolution described here:
